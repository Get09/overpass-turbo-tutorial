# overpass-turbo-turorial
Code examples and tutorial on getting data out of OpenStreetMap

Overpass turbo allows you to query anything in OpenStreetMap. The only real limit seems to be size. So, trying to download the nation's freeway system may not be possible. But you could for Los Angeles County.

A good start is defining what you want in terms of OSM's tags. 

## Get all drinking fountains in Griffith Park

For instance, to download all the water fountains in Griffith Park you'll need to use OSM's tag [amenity=drinking_watter](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Ddrinking_water). A quick Google search of search of the OSM Wiki will help you.

The easiest thing to do is to drop `amenity=drinking_watter` into Overpass turbo's "Wizard" if the map is showing Griffith Park.

```

[out:json][timeout:25];
// gather results
(
  // query part for: “amenity=drinking_water”
  node["amenity"="drinking_water"]({{bbox}});
  way["amenity"="drinking_water"]({{bbox}});
  relation["amenity"="drinking_water"]({{bbox}});
);
// print results
out body;

out skel qt;
```

## Request too big?
You can download straight out of Overpass turbo if you're request is too big.
